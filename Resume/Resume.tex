\section{Summary} % =====================================
 \cvitem{}{%
	Passionate technologist, enthusiastic learner, strong communicator, and experienced leader. Excited to take on new opportunities and challanges. I have spent time building skills across several different software industries since I was young. I am at my best when trailblazing, and enjoy working as both a self-starter, a team member, and also as a mentor. While I focus myself as a developer, I love working with all parts of the software cycle: From management, to quality, to marketing, development, and all parts in between.%
